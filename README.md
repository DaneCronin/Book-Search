  ## Description
   This is a MERN Stack application powered by the Google Books API. Users can search, view, save, and delete books from their saved books once they have created an account and logged in.

  ## Installation
  *Steps required to install project and how to get application running*
  
  Start by installing front and backend dependencies from the command line in the root directory. While in this directory, run the following command:
  
  npm install or npm i
  
  This should install the necessary node modules within the server and the client folders.
  After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

  npm start

  
  Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.


  ## Usage
  *Instructions and examples for use:*

  Users can search and view books by title or author. Users can then signup and login to save their favorite books to a saved list, and also delete the books at a later date if they wish.
